# ETAAcademy-ZK-Meme: Learn zk in One Sentence

ETA Academy is a research community dedicated to zero-knowledge proofs (zk). Fueled by a daily Twitter check-in summarizing one zk learning point, the ETAcademy-ZK-Meme series was born. With the initial 50 entries, we aim for this meme collection to become everyone's go-to pocket guide for understanding zk quickly. Join the movement and help us make zk accessible!

Here are some ways to participate in the ETAAcademy-ZK-Meme series:

- Create your own memes and share them on Twitter with the hashtag #ETAcademyZKMeme.
- Translate the memes into other languages.
- Use the memes to teach others about zk.

By participating in the series, you can help to make zk more accessible to everyone.

## C

Cyclic Group or Monogenous Group is a group generated by a single element🐬， $<🐬> = { 🐬^k | k ∈ Z },$ and the more such 🐬, the more powerful properties <🐬>

## D

Direct Product, 🍬×🍤 <=> 🍱, is an operation that takes two groups G 🍬 and H 🍤and constructs a new group 🍱, usually denoted G × H, in turn, which looks like a group 🍱 has many 🍬sub.groups 🍤.

## H

Homo and Iso: Similar to group homomorphisms (addition) but with multiplication, ring homomorphisms has a kernel, the inverse image of 0. The Isomorphism asserts that two rings share identical structures with different element names, e.g. the quotient ring R/Ker(f) ≅ Im(f)

## I

Ideals (I) and Quotient Rings (R/I) are like normal subgroups with Absorption Law and quotient groups. 🐣(I) include {0}, R itself, and principal ideals (a) = {ab | b ∈ R}, while 🐥R/I has add (a+I)+(b+I)=a+b+I, mult (a+I)(b+I)=ab+I, with a congruence relation a≡b(mod I).

## P

Primitive Root & Discrete Logarithm: An integer g 🐳 is a primitive root (mod n) that generates every element for a group $Z_n^*,$ So g🐳 may serve as a base $🧜‍♀️g^x$ ≡ a (mod n) for a discrete logarithm x = $log_g^a$ and as a generator 🐬for a cyclic group <🐬> = { $🐬^k$ | k ∈ Z }

Polynomial P(x) = $Σ_{j=0}^{n}{a_jx^j}$ is a sum of terms with the highest power of deg(P), its coefficient Lc(P), common add and mult, while factoring used to find roots (x for P(x)=0) construct L*i(x) for Lagrange interpolation P(x) = $Σ*{i=0}^n y_i ⋅L_i(x).$

## R

Ring simply seen as a group has two binary operations, ➕ and ✖️, e.g. the rings of integers Z and integers modulo n Zn are also groups. Now for a ring's interesting feature: based on Distributive Law, (-🍬)🐶 = -(🍬🐶) = 🍬(-🐶) = -(-🍬)(-🐶), if 🍬, 🐶 ∈ R 🪐.
