# ETAAcademy-ZK-Meme: Learn zk in One Sentence

ETA Academy is a research community dedicated to zero-knowledge proofs (zk). Fueled by a daily Twitter check-in summarizing one zk learning point, the ETAcademy-ZK-Meme series was born. With the initial 50 entries, we aim for this meme collection to become everyone's go-to pocket guide for understanding zk quickly. Join the movement and help us make zk accessible!

Here are some ways to participate in the ETAAcademy-ZK-Meme series:

- Create your own memes and share them on Twitter with the hashtag #ETAcademyZKMeme.
- Translate the memes into other languages.
- Use the memes to teach others about zk.

By participating in the series, you can help to make zk more accessible to everyone.
