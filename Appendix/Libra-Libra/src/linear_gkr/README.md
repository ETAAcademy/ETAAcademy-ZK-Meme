## File Format

In the first line, input a integer `d` represent the number of layers.
Input layer has layer number `0` output layer has layer number `d-1`

For next `d` lines, each line specify a layer.

In this first line, it specifies the input layer, the first number is `n`, specifies the number of gates in this layer, next `4n` numbers represents `n` gates. For each gate, we use 4 integers to describe: `ty gate_id value dummy`, indicates the type of the gate, the id of the gate and the input value of the gate, last value is a dummy value for alignment purpose.

For `i`-th line, it specifies the layer `i - 1`, the first number is `n`, specifies the number of gates in this layer. `n` must be a multiple of `2`.
The rest of this line contains `4n` integers, represent `n` gates. For each gate, we use 4 integers to describe: `ty g u v`, indicates the type of the gate, and the connection of the gate, `g` is the gate number, `u` is the left input of the gate, `v` is the right input of the gate.

We have `3` different types of gates for now. They are addition, multiplication, dummy. Dummy gate takes no input, and never serves as a input of other gate.

`ty=0` is addition gate, `ty=1` is multiplication gate, `ty=2` is dummy gate, `ty=3` is input gate, `ty=4` is direct relay gate, `ty=5` is summation gateï¼Œ `ty=6` is not gate, `ty=7` is minus gate, `ty=8` is XOR gate, `ty=9` is NAAB gate ($\not x \land y$), `ty=10` is relay gate.

## Special gate explain
### Direct relay gate
Do not use it in the circuit description, it's a gate that we use it to simplify computation. The gate just directly copy the value from the node in previous layer which has the same label as the direct relay gate.

### Summation gate
It's a gate that output the summation of previous layer. A simple use case is matrix multiplication.

## Example
```
3 \\two layers
4 3 0 1 1 3 1 1 1 3 2 1 1 3 3 1 1
2 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 3 \\first gate is addition, and second is a multiplication
1 1 0 0 1 \\this is the output layer, it's a multiplication gate
```
