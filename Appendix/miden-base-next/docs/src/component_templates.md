# Account component templates

An account component template provides a general description of an account component. It encapsulates all the information needed to initialize and manage the component.

Specifically, a template specifies a component's **metadata** and its **code**.

Once defined, a component template can be instantiated as account components, which can then be merged to form the account's `Code`.

## Component code

The component templateâ€™s code defines a library of functions that operate on the specified storage layout.

## Component metadata

The component metadata describes the account component entirely: its name, description, version, and storage layout.

The storage layout must specify a contiguous list of slot values that starts at index `0`, and can optionally specify initial values for each of the slots. Alternatively, placeholders can be utilized to identify values that should be provided at the moment of instantiation.

### TOML specification

The component metadata can be defined using TOML. Below is an example specification:

```toml
name = "Fungible Faucet"
description = "This component showcases the component template format, and the different ways of 
providing valid values to it."
version = "1.0.0"
supported-types = ["FungibleFaucet"]

[[storage]]
name = "token_metadata"
description = "Contains metadata about the token associated to the faucet account. The metadata
is formed by three fields: max supply, the token symbol and the asset's decimals"
slot = 0
value = [
    { type = "felt", name = "max_supply", description = "Maximum supply of the token in base units" },
    { type = "token_symbol", value = "TST" },
    { type = "u8", name = "decimals", description = "Number of decimal places for converting to absolute units", value = "10" },
    { value = "0x0" }
]

[[storage]]
name = "owner_public_key"
description = "This is a value placeholder that will be interpreted as a Falcon public key"
slot = 1
type = "auth::rpo_falcon512::pub_key"

[[storage]]
name = "map_storage_entry"
slot = 2
values = [
    { key = "0x1", value = ["0x0", "249381274", "998123581", "124991023478"] },
    { key = "0xDE0B1140012A9FD912F18AD9EC85E40F4CB697AE", value = { name = "value_placeholder", description = "This value will be defined at the moment of instantiation" } }
]

[[storage]]
name = "multislot_entry"
slots = [3,4]
values = [
    ["0x1","0x2","0x3","0x4"],
    ["50000","60000","70000","80000"]
]
```

#### Specifying values and their types

In the TOML format, any value that is one word long can be written as a single value, or as exactly four field elements. In turn, a field element is a number within Miden's finite field. 

A word can be written as a hexadecimal value, and field elements can be written either as hexadecimal or decimal numbers. In all cases, numbers should be input as strings.

In our example, the `token_metadata` single-slot entry is defined as four elements, where the first element is a placeholder, and the second, third and fourth are hardcoded values.

##### Word types

Valid word types are `word` (default type) and `auth::rpo_falcon512::pub_key` (represents a Falcon public key). Both can be written and interpreted as hexadecimal strings.

##### Felt types

Valid field element types are `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `felt` (default type) and `token_symbol`:

- `u8`, `u16` and `u32` values can be parsed as decimal numbers and represent 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit unsigned integers
- `felt` values represent a field element, and can be parsed as decimal or hexadecimal values
- `token_symbol` values represent the symbol for basic fungible tokens, and are parsed as strings made of four uppercase characters

#### Header

The metadata header specifies four fields:

- `name`: The component template's name
- `description` (optional): A brief description of the component template and its functionality
- `version`: A semantic version of this component template
- `supported-types`: Specifies the types of accounts on which the component can be used. Valid values are `FungibleFaucet`, `NonFungibleFaucet`, `RegularAccountUpdatableCode` and `RegularAccountImmutableCode`

#### Storage entries

An account component template can have multiple storage entries. A storage entry can specify either a **single-slot value**, a **multi-slot value**, or a **storage map**.

Each of these storage entries contain the following fields:

- `name`: A name for identifying the storage entry
- `description` (optional): Describes the intended function of the storage slot within the component definition

Additionally, based on the type of the storage entry, there are specific fields that should be specified.

##### Single-slot value

A single-slot value fits within one slot (i.e., one word).

For a single-slot entry, the following fields are expected:

- `slot`: Specifies the slot index in which the value will be placed
- `value` (optional): Contains the initial storage value for this slot. Will be interpreted as a `word` unless another `type` is specified
- `type` (optional): Describes the expected type for the slot

If no `value` is provided, the entry acts as a placeholder, requiring a value to be passed at instantiation. In this case, specifying a `type` is mandatory to ensure the input is correctly parsed. So the rule is that at least one of `value` and `type` has to be specified.
Valid types for a single-slot value are `word` or `auth::rpo_falcon512::pub_key`.

In the above example, the first and second storage entries are single-slot values.

##### Storage map entries

[Storage maps](./account.md#storage) consist of key-value pairs, where both keys and values are single words.

Storage map entries can specify the following fields:

- `slot`: Specifies the slot index in which the root of the map will be placed
- `values`: Contains a list of map entries, defined by a `key` and `value`

Where `key`s and `value`s are word values, which can be defined as placeholders.

In the example, the third storage entry defines a storage map.

##### Multi-slot value

Multi-slot values are composite values that exceed the size of a single slot (i.e., more than one `word`).

For multi-slot values, the following fields are expected:

- `slots`: Specifies the list of contiguous slots that the value comprises
- `values`: Contains the initial storage value for the specified slots

Placeholders can currently not be defined for multi-slot values. In our example, the fourth entry defines a two-slot value.
