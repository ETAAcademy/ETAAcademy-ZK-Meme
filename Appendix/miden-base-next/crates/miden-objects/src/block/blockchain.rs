/// The [Merkle Mountain Range](Mmr) defining the Miden blockchain.
///
/// The values of the leaves in the MMR are the commitments of blocks, i.e.
/// [`BlockHeader::commitment`](crate::block::BlockHeader::commitment).
///
/// Each new block updates the blockchain by adding **the previous block's commitment** to the MMR.
/// This means the chain commitment found in block 10's header commits to all blocks 0..=9, but not
/// 10 itself. This results from the fact that block 10 cannot compute its own block commitment
/// and thus cannot add itself to the chain. Hence, the blockchain is lagging behind by one block.
///
/// Some APIs take a _checkpoint_ which is equivalent to the concept of _forest_ of the underlying
/// MMR. As an example, if the blockchain has 20 blocks in total, and the checkpoint is 10, then
/// the API works in the context of the chain at the time it had 10 blocks, i.e. it contains blocks
/// 0..=9. This is useful, for example, to retrieve proofs that are valid when verified against the
/// chain commitment of block 10.
///
/// The maximum number of supported blocks is [`u32::MAX`]. This is not validated however.
