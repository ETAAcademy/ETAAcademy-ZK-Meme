// PROVEN BLOCK
// ================================================================================================

/// A block in the Miden chain.
///
/// A block is built from batches of transactions, i.e. multiple
/// [`ProvenBatch`](crate::batch::ProvenBatch)es, and each batch contains multiple
/// [`ProvenTransaction`](crate::transaction::ProvenTransaction)s.
///
/// It consists of the following components:
/// - A [`BlockHeader`] committing to the current state of the chain and against which account, note
///   or nullifier inclusion or absence can be proven. See its documentation for details on what it
///   commits to. Eventually, it will also contain a ZK proof of the validity of the block.
/// - A list of account updates for all accounts updated in this block. For private accounts, the
///   update contains only the new account state commitments while for public accounts, the update
///   also includes the delta which can be applied to the previous account state to get the new
///   account state.
/// - A list of new notes created in this block. For private notes, the block contains only note IDs
///   and note metadata while for public notes the full note details are included.
/// - A list of new nullifiers created for all notes that were consumed in the block.
/// - A list of transaction headers that were included in the block.
