On March 13th, 2024, Ethereum will implement the Dencun upgrade. This upgrade consists of nine Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), of which EIP-4844 is the most significant and is expected to significantly reduce transaction costs for Layer 2 Rollups (e.g., zkSync, Scroll, Arbitrum, Optimism).

EIP-4844 is the proto-danksharding proposal put forward by Vitalik and others. The main proposal is to introduce a new type of transaction called a blob, which can carry a larger data packet (about 125KB) compared to the calldata of regular transactions, thereby reducing gas costs.

Blobs have lower execution costs and the data stored in them cannot be accessed by the EVM, they can only be viewed but not verified. However, validators and users can download these blobs, and EIP-4844 also introduces a limit on the maximum number of blobs in a block, and a new sharding mechanism. This change in data transmission solves the scalability problem of Ethereum.

RIP-7212 (formerly known as EIP-7212) is another important proposal in the Ethereum ecosystem, it introduces a precompiled contract to support the secp256r1 curve. The "secp256r1" elliptic curve is a curve standardized by NIST, and it has the same calculation method as the "secp256k1" elliptic curve used by the "ecrecover" precompiled contract (different input parameters).

RIP-7212 significantly reduces the gas cost of P256 curve verification from the current high level to only 3450 gas. This proposal simplifies the process of developing ERC-6900 compatible P256 verification contracts, and simplifies the process of adding biometric authentication to smart accounts. It has been accepted and is being implemented by some well-known Layer 2s (Kakarot, Polygon, Optimism, zkSync and Arbitrum).
